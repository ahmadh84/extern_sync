function f = compute_error_metric(masks, GT, params, type)
% Can compute different error measures given an output mask and a GT. It
% can also compute errors for multiple masks at the same time. The output
% is a vector of error scores of length N where N is the number of masks 
% provided.
%
% @args:
%   masks: is a logical array (size of the image) which gives the mask
%      output by an algorithm, whose overlap needs to be computed with the
%      provided ground-truth. You can provide multiple masks by
%      concatenating them on the 3rd dimension
%
%   GT: is an array (size of the image) giving the ground-truth over which 
%       all the masks are scored. GT can be of two types: (1) it can be an
%       array with only two values with one of them being zero (like a
%       logical array OR a double with 0 and 1 OR a uint8 with 0 and 128 OR
%       so on); (2) it can be an array with a range of value - in which
%       case params need to be provided to covert GT into a logical mask.
%
%   params: if in case GT is an array with a range of values, params could
%       be just a single value TH where fg = GT >= 0. It can also be a
%       vector of two values [TH1 TH2], such that GT >= TH1 & GT < TH2 is
%       ignored and fg = GT >= TH2. If GT is a logical array, you can opt
%       to provide a single value in param, telling the number of pixels 
%       around the boundary of GT which should be ignored (this should be
%       an odd number of pixels).
%
%   type (<'overlap'>, 'intersect_gt', 'centroid_displacement'): specifies
%       the type of overlap you want to compute. 'overlap' computes
%       TP/(FP+FN+TP). 'intersect_gt' computes the precision TP/(FP+TP).
%       'incorrect_pixels' computes FP+FN i.e. number of incorrect pixels.
