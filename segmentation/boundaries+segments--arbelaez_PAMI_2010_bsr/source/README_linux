Follow these steps to compile the Berkeley Segmentation Ressources from source code on Linux systems:

[ Tested on Ubuntu 12.10 with matlab-r2013a ]


1.  Prerequisites:

        a. We assume that you have matlab installed and mex is configured correctlly (type mex -setup in the matlab prompt).
        
        b. Make sure matlab is in your path, e.g.:
            $ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/matlab-r2011a/bin

        c. Make sure your system has the required image libraries:
            $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
            $ sudo apt-get install libpng-dev

	d. Force matlab to load the system's latest libraries, rather than its own older versions:
	    $ export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1;


2.  Compilation:

        
	a.  We assume that you uncompressed the .tgz file in a folder called /BSR/

	b.  Edit the following line in the file /BSR/grouping/source/gpb_src/Rules.make to point to the directory where matlab 
            is installed (example given below):

            MATLAB_PATH := /opt/matlab-r2011a

            Also, if you are using a 32-bit instead of a 64-bit architecture, uncomment
            the lines specifying 32-bit architecture and comment the lines specifying
            64-bit:

            # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (32-bit machines)
            MATLAB_ARCH := glnx86
            MEX_EXTN := mexglx

            # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (64-bit machines)
            #MATLAB_ARCH := glnxa64
            #MEX_EXTN := mexa64

        c. go to /BSR/grouping/source and type the following command:
            $ source build.sh

            This script should build all the packages and copy the resulting .mex files into the /BSR/grouping/lib directory.

3.  Usage examples:

        a. /BSR/grouping/test_gPb_ucm.m : Run gPb_ucm on a small image to test compilation.

        b. /BSR/grouping/example.m: usage examples of gPb_ucm, including support for large images.

        c. /BSR/bench/test_benchs.m: usage examples of BSDS500 benchmarks with various input formats.
