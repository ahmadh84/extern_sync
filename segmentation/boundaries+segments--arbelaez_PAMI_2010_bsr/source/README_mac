Follow these steps to compile the Berkeley Segmentation Ressources from source code on Mac systems:

[ Tested on OS X 10.7 with matlab-r2011a ]


1.  Prerequisites:

        a. We assume that you have matlab installed and mex is configured correctlly (type mex -setup in the matlab prompt).
        
        b. Make sure matlab is in your path, e.g.:
            $ export PATH=/Applications/MATLAB_R2011a.app/bin:$PATH

        c. Install XCode >= 4.3

        d. Install XCode command line tools 
            (see: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html)

            NOTE: If you previously had XCode < 4.3 you will need to edit your mexopts.sh file to set the SDKROOT to the new SDKPATH path, e.g.,
            SDKROOT='/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/'
            (see: http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-FR6LXJ/)

        e. Install macports (see: http://www.macports.org/)

        f. Use macports to install the required image libraries:
            $ sudo port install jpeg
            $ sudo port install libpng
            

2.  Compilation:

	a.  We assume that you uncompressed the .tgz file in a folder called /BSR/

        b.  Overwrite the default linux make files with the Mac versions:
            $ cp -f /BSR/grouping/source/gpb_src/Rules.make_mac /BSR/grouping/source/gpb_src/Rules.make
            $ cp -f /BSR/grouping/source/buildW/Makefile_mac /BSR/grouping/source/buildW/Makefile

        c.  Edit the following line in the file /BSR/grouping/source/gpb_src/Rules.make to point to the directory where matlab 
            is installed (example given below):

            MATLAB_PATH := /Applications/MATLAB_R2011a.app/

        d. go to /BSR/grouping/source and type the following command:
            $ source build.sh

            This script should build all the packages and copy the resulting .mex files into the grouping/lib directory.


3.  Usage examples:

        a. /BSR/grouping/test_gPb_ucm.m : Run gPb_ucm on a small image to test compilation.

        b. /BSR/grouping/example.m: usage examples of gPb_ucm, including support for large images.

        c. /BSR/bench/test_benchs.m: usage examples of BSDS500 benchmarks with various input formats.
