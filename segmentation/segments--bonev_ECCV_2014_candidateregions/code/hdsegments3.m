function [segh] = hdsegments3(image, doplot, model, edgesWeight, slicSize, slicRegu, ratioMerge, nfewsegments)
% Input:    image in RGB or image path
% Optional: doplot is true by default to show plots during segmentation
%           edgeprior grayscale image with edges
%           edgepriorWeight from 0 to approximately 10. default is 1
% Output:   segh is an array of segmentsHandle handles to objects
%           segh(i).segments contains the segments map of level i
