Installation. Just decompress, third-party libraries are included in lib/. 
Tested on Linux 64bits with Matlab 2013b. The code and all third-party libraries used should work on Mac and Windows after recompiling their .mex files. 

Usage. Run code/demo.m and find the results in output/

The input images are in the input/JPEGImages folder, and their list is read from input/ImageSets/sample.txt.
The evaluation looks for these images in input/Groundtruth/, which is a reduced version of http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ccvl/datasets/pascal-context/
