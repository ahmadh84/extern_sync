Key-Segments Video Segmentation README File
-------------------------------------------


1. Using the code

There are 2 demo files:

a) hypotheses_demo.m: discovers keysegment hypotheses (i.e., clusters) in ranked-order of their object-like properties.
b) keySegs_demo.m: produces a binary segmentation of the object corresponding to the specified keysegment hypothesis.



2. Notes

The code assumes that the video frames are stored in order (i.e., frame 1 is the first file, frame 2 is the second file),
and that the files types are either jpg, png, or bmp.  (The code can be easily changed to accomodate other file types.) 

The code assumes that the BPLRs [1], region proposals [2], and optical flows [3] are pre-computed.  
You can download the pre-computed data for the SegTrack dataset here: vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/keysegments/data.tgz
Example code for computing them are provided in ./code/preprocessing/

The segmentation demo code (keySegs_demo.m) produces slightly different results to those reported in the paper ("Ours" in Table 1);
better for 3 videos, similar for 2 videos, and worse for 1 video.  This is due to changes in the BPLR parameters.
The results for the color-only method ("Ours w/o partial shape match" in Table 2) are identical.
